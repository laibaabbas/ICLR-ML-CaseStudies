# ICLR-ML-CaseStudies

## Machine Learning Case Studies 📘

This repository contains my implementations of 5 machine learning case studies from the book **"Python Machine Learning Case Studies"**.  
Each chapter is explored through a separate Jupyter notebook, with step-by-step analysis, code, and results.

### 📂 Contents

- **Ch1 - Cycle Sharing**  
  Predicting the number of bicycles rented in a city using regression models. Covers EDA, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

- **Ch2 - Concrete Compressive Strength**  
  Predicting compressive strength of concrete using regression techniques. Includes handling inconsistent data and advanced modeling.

- **Ch3 - Yahoo Stock Prediction**  
  Time series forecasting of Yahoo stock prices using ML regression models.

- **Ch4 - Research Paper Classification**  
  Text classification of research papers using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

- **Ch5 - Medical Appointment No-show**  
  Classification model to predict whether a patient will show up for their medical appointment.
